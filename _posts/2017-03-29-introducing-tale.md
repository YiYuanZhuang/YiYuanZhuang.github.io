The Copenhagen House Price Puzzle: Uncovering Convenient Amenities

In the old and modern city of Copenhagen, the secret of house prices is like a treasure hidden underneath the beautiful streets and canals. Our website takes you on a journey to unravel this mystery through cutting-edge data visualisation techniques. Our goal is to give you not only the information you need to find your future home, but also to enjoy the journey of discovery.

## The beginning of the story: the discovery of the problem
First, we invite you to explore two unique perspectives:
1. Graph of correlation coefficients between house prices and neighbourhood amenities: This graph will show the mysterious connection between the number of amenities per unit area and house prices in different areas. Which amenities really push up house prices? Which ones are unexpectedly unrelated to house prices? The story behind the data awaits your discovery.

FINDINGS: As you can see from the chart, the types of amenities that have a high correlation with house prices include metro stations (0.7), gyms (0.7), shops (0.66) and restaurants (0.63). This may indicate that house prices are higher in well-located and convenient areas. The abundance of commercial and leisure facilities has a significant impact on the attractiveness of the area in which one lives, which in turn drives up house prices. Comparatively, firms have the lowest correlation coefficient (0. 4), suggesting that the distribution of firms has less of a direct impact on house prices. While firms may bring economic activity and employment opportunities to the city, the distribution and type of firms has a relatively low direct impact on house prices, especially when compared to amenities that directly affect the quality of life of residents. This may be due to the fact that firms are often concentrated in commercial or industrial areas, which may be less attractive to live in than residential areas with good amenities.

2. Scatterplot of regional house prices against amenity scores: Conventional wisdom is that "the more amenities, the higher the house price", but our data paints a more complex picture when the correlation coefficients are used to calculate the amenity scores of different neighbourhoods in relation to house prices. This will challenge your expectations and provoke you to think outside the box.

FINDINGS: It is clear from the scatterplot that there is a subtle relationship between house prices and amenity scores in each district:
 Overall, there is no clear linear relationship between scores (Scores) and house prices (Average House Price (DKK)). While Frederiksberg, the highest scoring district in the upper right corner of the chart, has the highest scores and the highest house prices, the other districts do not follow this principle.
 Other than that, the rest of the scatter takes on the shape of a crescent, which leads us to notice the two cusps:
 A (top left corner of the scatter): Gentofte and København, where house prices are in the TOP 3, but the amenities score is only about 20 out of 100.
 B (bottom right of the scatterplot): Rødovre and Herlev, with amenity scores in the TOP 3, but house prices only in the middle 30W (up to 600K)
 The emergence of these two extremes makes us wonder what is behind this phenomenon.
 There are many factors that influence house prices, such as population, socio-economics, city policies, and market supply and demand status. In this study, we introduced population and economy as auxiliary research in addition to the factor of city facilities.



## Deeper Exploration: Uncovering the Story Behind the Data

It is an "elaborate" ballet of thefts, with a number of different crime types spinning around over the course of a few hours as you tap the different types of thefts with your finger.



To this day, larceny/theft in San Francisco is still the number one crime type that troubles the local police department and residents. The analysis of this article hopes to bring more confidence to local residents in dealing with theft, and also inject more determination into the police department to solve this problem. We remain hopeful for a new San Francisco filled with freedom and security!
