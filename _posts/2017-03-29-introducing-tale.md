Welcome to San Francisco Larceny/Theft Crime webpage!

San Francisco(SF) is a city full of freedom, but it is also overshadowed by rampant larceny/theft. This article is based on the crime data of the San Francisco Police Department from 2013 to 2017 [1], tracking the silent traces of theft, and analyzing the model of theft crime from the perspectives of time, space, and different types.  We look forward to bringing inspiration to local residents in dealing with theft crimes, while exploring more possibilities for optimizing police investment in San Francisco.

## "Carnival" Under the Night
A comprehensive investigation in San Francisco found that the incidence of theft is shocking, affecting more than half of the city's residents. These incidents involve an astonishing number of blatant car intrusions, often occurring in areas popular with tourists. This unsettling reality resonates deeply with the widespread civic disillusionment in this city. [2] To improve this situation, we first analyzed the distribution of theft in SF during a 24-hour cycle.

## Fiery Northeast
What catches the eye is a hot theft crime map. The red lighting up the northeastern heart of the city in San Francisco is not good news because it means theft is rampant.



## Dangerous Theft Ballet

It is an "elaborate" ballet of thefts, with a number of different crime types spinning around over the course of a few hours as you tap the different types of thefts with your finger.



To this day, larceny/theft in San Francisco is still the number one crime type that troubles the local police department and residents. The analysis of this article hopes to bring more confidence to local residents in dealing with theft, and also inject more determination into the police department to solve this problem. We remain hopeful for a new San Francisco filled with freedom and security!
